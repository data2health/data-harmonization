# Research Design
Working with the CTSA and HIT standards communities to identify a canonical data model for CTSA elements, and evolving in partnership with traditional research common data models migration pathways.  FHIR is proposed as the most practical basis for such a canonical model.
# Methodology
We anticipate many points of engagement:
*	Primary consultation with CTSA hubs through workshops, video conference, and collaboration tools
*	Leverage linkages to standards developers such as HL7 and ONC, focusing on FHIR resources
*	Engage traditional common data models to develop or validation inter-model transformation
# Expected Outcomes
**EXAMPLE FROM SCITS:**
The primary outcomes for this project are:
* a warehouse integrating the spectrum of expertise and services described above, and
* a suite of services that hubs and others (e.g. CLIC) can interrogate and/or embed into their local information environments.
# Timeline (monthly)
* 6/1 – Experiment with FHIR server as back-end for CTSA EHR data
* 6/1 – Begin evaluation of legacy data models into FHIR servers
* 7/1 – Incorporate one innovative FHIR resource, relevant to translational research, into FHIR server as demonstration
* 8/1 – Explore data transfer into FHIR server via FHIR Bulk API
* 9/14 – Participate in HL7 FHIR Hackathon in Atlanta
* 9/26 – Demonstrate FHIR server functionality at CTSA Program Meeting
* 1/1 – Deploy FHIR server at two CTSA hubs
* 1/1 – Demonstrate migration from legacy data model into FHIR server
* 1/1 -  Begin exploring federated query via FHIR Bulk API
# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
**EXAMPLE FROM SCITS:**
A substantial number of external sources are already being regularly harvested and integrated into SciTS: educational resources (DIAMOND, N-Lighten, BD2K GitHub repositories), data repositories (e.g., DataCite), GitHub repositories, etc. - significantly reducing the overall risk to success in populating SciTS. Key outstanding potential challenges include:
* successful harmonization of educational resources, simplifying the current diversity of their descriptions,
* formulation of an effective descriptive framework for services provided by CTSA hubs, and
* significant services adoption by the hubs and other organizations.

The first two involve primarily modeling and alignment with and by external teams.  We have been in continued consultation with the education platform teams and the SPARC team at MUSC to ensure our work aligns well with their plans. The last one is more demonstrating utility to the population of hubs.  We have already received strong interest from various hubs for particular services - e.g. from Medical College of Wisconsin for a service listing open funding opportunities relevant to their investigator profiles and from Wisconsin-Madison for a service listing W-M personnel active on CD2H projects.  We will continue to recruit suggestions from hubs for services seen as high value to their local environment.
