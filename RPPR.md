# Research Design
Working with the CTSA and HIT standards communities to identify a canonical data model for CTSA elements, and evolving in partnership with traditional research common data models migration pathways.  FHIR is proposed as the most practical basis for such a canonical model.
# Methodology
We anticipate many points of engagement:
- Primary consultation with CTSA hubs through 
# Expected Outcomes
**EXAMPLE FROM SCITS:**
The primary outcomes for this project are:
* a warehouse integrating the spectrum of expertise and services described above, and
* a suite of services that hubs and others (e.g. CLIC) can interrogate and/or embed into their local information environments.
# Timeline (monthly)
**EXAMPLE FROM SCITS:**
* 6/1 - Version 1 of the SciTS warehouse, including connectivity via JDBC and GraphQL interfaces, and content including CD2H resources/status, NIH FOAs, ClinicalTrials.gov personnel/expertise, REDCap instrument libraries, CTSA-relevant GitHub repositories/personnel/expertise
* 6/1 - Integration of the data generated by the WashU CDEK regarding disambiguated organizations, molecules, etc. from ClinicalTrials.gov into SciTS warehouse
* 6/1 - Landscape analysis of scholar reporting best practices
* 8/1 - Deployment of a set of researcher disambiguation services using tools from Harvard, Weill Cornell and Iowa linking hubs and their investigators to publications and grants
* 9/1 - Full expansion to semantic search within 4DM (via UMLS CUIs) with the CD2H faceted search engine
* 9/20 - Scholar tracking uidebook, dashboard, use cases
* 1/1 - Deployment of CTSA hub service catalog in the CD2H faceted search engine
* 1/1 - Coverage of CTSA hub web content harvesting to include partner organizations
* 1/1 -  v. 2.0 of warehouse deployed (incl. Hub service catalog and expanded set of widgets)

# Potential Pitfalls and Alternative Strategies
**EXAMPLE FROM SCITS:**
A substantial number of external sources are already being regularly harvested and integrated into SciTS: educational resources (DIAMOND, N-Lighten, BD2K GitHub repositories), data repositories (e.g., DataCite), GitHub repositories, etc. - significantly reducing the overall risk to success in populating SciTS. Key outstanding potential challenges include:
* successful harmonization of educational resources, simplifying the current diversity of their descriptions,
* formulation of an effective descriptive framework for services provided by CTSA hubs, and
* significant services adoption by the hubs and other organizations.

The first two involve primarily modeling and alignment with and by external teams.  We have been in continued consultation with the education platform teams and the SPARC team at MUSC to ensure our work aligns well with their plans. The last one is more demonstrating utility to the population of hubs.  We have already received strong interest from various hubs for particular services - e.g. from Medical College of Wisconsin for a service listing open funding opportunities relevant to their investigator profiles and from Wisconsin-Madison for a service listing W-M personnel active on CD2H projects.  We will continue to recruit suggestions from hubs for services seen as high value to their local environment.
