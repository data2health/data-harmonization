# Example Engagement Plan

We are looking for community participation in the following areas:
- x
- y
- z

If you are interested in participating, please [onboard here](http://bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form)

Community dissemination of the work in an ongoing fashion should also be indicated. Please describe the communities and the dissemination vehicles you are planning. 

Each project will also be expected to provide the occasional blog, announcements in the CD2H newsletter, and report outs at iDTF Show and Tells and Community Workgroups, and a timeline for inclusion on the labs page (for relevant projects).
