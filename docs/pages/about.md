## About

### Clinical Data Harmonization

The emergence and prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs)  fundamentally transformed th opportunities   for efficient translational research at scale. However, the syntactic and semantic content of EHRs remain sufficiently inconsistent between and among implementations that additional efforts for normalization are necessary across a Federated network such as the CTSA. This project is about enabling comparable and consistent representation of clinical data across the CTSA network to support federated query and facilitate large-scale translational research collaboration.
