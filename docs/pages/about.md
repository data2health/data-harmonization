## About

### Clinical Data Harmonization

The emergence and prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs)  fundamentally transformed th opportunities   for efficient translational research at scale. However, the syntactic and semantic content of EHRs remain sufficiently inconsistent between and among implementations that additional efforts for normalization are necessary across a Federated network such as the CTSA. This project is about enabling comparable and consistent representation of clinical data across the CTSA network to support federated query and facilitate large-scale translational research collaboration. 

### Project Description

Many excellent common data models exist in the translational research space. While such diversity may seem a feature, it actually complicates the efforts of CTSA hubs to support all of them. Furthermore, the widely shared goal of CTSA's functioning as an integrated network of investigators and data is challenged by the heterogeneity across data repositories.

The Accelerating Clinical Trials (ACT) is an effort to achieve an effective clinical data network across the CTSA community.  CD2H is working closely with ACT to simplify the task of creating a shared repository, and to interoperate with collegial data networks such as OHDSI, PCORNet, and TriNetX.
