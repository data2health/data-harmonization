## Provide Feedback

There are a number of ways to provide feedback on the data-harmonization projects. 

* Create an [Issue](https://github.com/data2health/data-harmonization/issues) on the data-harmonization GitHub page. This will notify the data-harmonization team lead of the proposed issue and bring it to the attention of the project team. Data-harmonization is a public and open GitHub repository, which allows other members of the CTSA consortium to view and comment on the issues, and to work together toward solutions.

* Onboard with the [CD2H](https://bit.ly/cd2h-onboarding-form). By formally onboarding with the Center for Data to Health Community, you can be a contributor in the task teams of your choice, or be added to our data-harmonization specific mailing lists as well as be invited to attend periodic All-Hands web meetings. The All-Hands meetings include project updates and provides CD2H team members valuable interaction time.
