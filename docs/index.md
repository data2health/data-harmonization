The CD2H Data Harmonization project, part of the CD2H Next Generation Data Repository Core, identifies and curates resources and tools that enable a common framework for rendering and querying clinical data. Central to the effort is designating the HL7 FHIR specification as a canonical hub to simplify integration from clinical electronic health records and transform into a broad spectrum of translational research data models. We do this by engaging expertise across the CTSA community through workshops, electronic workspaces, and community web events.

### Federated Data Query Workshop May 20 & 21st, 2019
The Data Harmonization Working Group in CD2H hosted a two-day (May 20-21) workshop in Baltimore on data harmonization and federated query. 
For details about this workshop, including industry subject matter expert presentations, see this link:  [Workshop](https://data2health.github.io/data-harmonization/pages/BaltimoreWorkshop.html)
    

### CDM-FHIR Mappings

Mapping to, from, and among translational research common data models can be greatly facilitated by invoking FHIR as a canonical hub.  An analyis of many existing mapping is updated on this page:  [CDM-FHIR Mappings](pages/CDM-FHIR.md). 

There are many [FHIR Servers options](pages/fhir-repo.md) for FHIR repositories.

* The CDM-FHIR Gap Analaysis Task Team has complied the most [comprehensive mappings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mrt0xFfvcYhOfoAq_KnT7R5bYk7TZ6h0?usp=sharing) assembled to date. If you know of any other mappings that you do not see here, please add.

### HL7 FHIR Standard Engagement

The CD2H team is engaging the HL7 and FHIR communities around interoperability standards critical to large-scale translational research.  A summary of current activities is here:  [HL7 Engagement and Translational Research Working Group](https://data2health.github.io/data-harmonization/pages/HL7_WG.html)

[HL7 Engagement Webinar, Nov 12th, noon ET/9 am PT, register here (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x83iZY4LX41TKyndtZMXD5Cwx6kiRUJ2/view?usp=sharing)]
- The FHIR development process at HL7 
- HL7 working group and committee organization 
- Current HL7 working groups and proposals for research activities 
- The HL7 FHIR Accelerator program (Argonaut, DaVinci, etc) and a progress toward a research accelerator
- How CTSA hubs might most efficiently engage in the process

### Data Harmonization Maturity Model

* The Sustainability and Change Management Task Team has developed a data harmonization maturity model and it is ready for wider CTSA Community input.  Please review and add your feedback to [Data Harmonization Maturity Model](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IKKbSxe19ZgayDnv5cqTUzDswNGWQvKZNUc2IgZvaL8/edit?usp=sharing).

### FHIR for Translational Research Blog

Prompted by the recent NIH statement endorsing the use of FHIR for research clinical data, CD2H authored this blog: [Forging Translational Research Networks with FHIR](https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/blog/forging-translational-research-networks-with-fhir/).
