# data-harmonization
Clinical data in CTSA hubs are not readily queryable in a federated fashion.  Many efforts exist to address this, including TriNetX, ACT, PCORNet, and OHDSI among others.  Unifying these with an HL7 FHIR framework is an aspiration. 

Enabling the CTSA to function as a federated network of clinical data, supporting multicenter research is among the core goals of the program. This project advances that agenda through common data model harmonization.

## Problem statement
Data respositories across CTSA hubs need to have semantic and syntactic alignment to support federated query.  This must impose a minimal maintenence burden on CTSA hub sites.  Leveraging the native FHIR APIs, no proposed as required for US EHRs by CMS, would mitigate ETL costs and maintenence issues.

## Project description
(we will migrate these from the Project Matrix for you)

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.

Point person (github handle) | Site | Program Director
----------|--------------|---------------
Tricia Francis (@tricfran) | JHU | Chris Chute (@cgchute)

## Leads 

Project scientific leadership, should be 1-3 persons.

## Team members 

No action required here, a list of team members will be imported and linked below.

See https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/tree/master/team.md

## Repositories

List Github repositories associated with the project. Each project requires at least one repository to house the administrative tracking and public information. You can either add this information to an existing repository, or create a new one and list the associated repositories below. Please be sure to tag any repositories not under the data2health organization with the topic 'data2health'. Project repositories must be public. Some repositories may be private for sensitivity or operational reasons. 

Example repos:
- https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template
- https://github.com/data2health/operations; private repo editable by members of team @data2health/ops

## Deliverables
Each project should propose one or more deliverables. Examples: a released code package, a best practices document, a final survey, a set of survey results, etc.

## Milestones 
Each deliverable is represented as a Milestone, but not all Milestones need be deliverables. For example, see this 'report on XYZ' is a [Deliverable Milestone](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/milestone/2)

Please create 4-8 Milestones for each project, with dates prior to August 31st.  Milestones for partially completed deliverables are acceptable: beta release of software, # interviews performed, 75% coverage, etc. 

Each Milestone must have at least one Issue (aka 'ticket'), each issue should be assigned to a person, preferably one at a time; reassignments are fine. Issues with checklists showing degree of completion are also acceptable, see [example](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/2).

GitHub help on Milestones is [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-milestones-for-issues-and-pull-requests/)

## Evaluation
Each project should propose a set of evaluation measures, recorded in a separate Evaluation Plan file, for example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/evaluation.md). These will be reviewed by the Evaluation committee and approved by the Program Directors and NCATS. The Evaluation committee will meet with each Project team leads to assist. 

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in GitHub using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
[Documentating projects in Github](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/)

[The project Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1vLp-H32KTNobiZF2cK82At90S6dVJNUf) is accessible to onboarded participants. 

## Slack room
[The project slack room](https://cd2h.slack.com/messages/C9D9SQWEQ) is accessible to onboarded participants. You will not automatically be added to Slack, please join via the link above.
