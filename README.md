# data-harmonization
Clinical data in CTSA hubs are not readily queryable in a federated fashion.  Many efforts exist to address this, including TriNetX, ACT, PCORNet, and OHDSI among others.  Unifying these with an HL7 FHIR framework is an aspiration. 

Enabling the CTSA to function as a federated network of clinical data, supporting multicenter research is among the core goals of the program. This project advances that agenda through common data model harmonization.

## Problem statement
Data respositories across CTSA hubs need to have semantic and syntactic alignment to support federated query.  This must impose a minimal maintenence burden on CTSA hub sites.  Leveraging the native FHIR APIs, no proposed as required for US EHRs by CMS, would mitigate ETL costs and maintenence issues.

## Project description
(we will migrate these from the Project Matrix for you)

## Alignment to program objectives
TODO see [here](https://github.com/data2health/roadmap/blob/master/cd2h-foa.md)

### Sub-projects
- [Clinical adaptor](https://github.com/data2health/clinical-adaptor)
- [ehr2HPO](https://github.com/data2health/ehr2HPO.prj)

## Contact person

We require a contact person for each project for administrative purposes. Each project should also have a CD2H Program director assigned.

Point person (github handle) | Site | Program Director
----------|--------------|---------------
Tricia Francis (@tricfran) | JHU | Chris Chute (@cgchute)

## Leads 

Project scientific leadership, should be 1-3 persons.

## Team members 

No action required here, a list of team members will be imported and linked below.

See https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/tree/master/team.md

## Repositories

Many repositories could be listed here, including FHIR sites and CDM data models.  However, for parsimony, we presently list only the tightly related CD2H child repo.
Child repo:
- https://github.com/data2health/clinical-adaptor

## Deliverables
Key long-term deliverables
- A coherent common data model across CTSA hubs, arising naturally from their EHR sources.
- Shared terminology services across the CTSA community 

## Milestones 
Milestones are listed, though at present are quite general.

## Evaluation
Evaluation of data harmonization will ultimately rest with its impact on our community.  The goal is to enable federated query and inferencing at scale across the CTSA community.  There are likley to be many lesser advantages and consequences.  Several evaluation issues are in place, though we expect they will evolve with time.  

Each project should have Evaluation-realated issues, that can be tagged with the "evaluation" tag. see [Example Evaluation Issue](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/issues/5)

## Education
Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. 
Please reference any of the following that apply: 
- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education". 

## Get involved
We encourage the community to get involved. 

We require all CD2H projects to have non-CD2H CTSA participants, as CD2H is a CTSA coordinating center. Each project should include an Engagement plan file, example [here](https://github.com/data2health/project-repo-template/blob/master/engagement.md). 

Please tag any engagment related issues with "engagement".

## Working documents
Documentation may be natively in GitHub using the wiki or .md files in the appropriate folder, or in Google Drive.
