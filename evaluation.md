# Sample evaluation plan

We will evaluate the outcome of this project in the following, highly generalize ways.  More detailed and sequential metrics are in prearation.

- Measure the present status of common data models across CTSAs dynamically (dynamic self report)
- Measure the preparedness for CTSA sites to embrace a next-generation FHIR repository
- Ultimatey measure the adoption of FHIR-based data repositories
- Finally measure the impact of a common, shared data model on federated query and analytics
