Each project should propose a set of educational activities, listed separately in the Education Plan file. Please reference any of the following that apply:

- Educational resources that will be generated (these can be milestones and/or files in the repo)
- Educational opportunities (please indicate for which type of learner and how to participate)
- Best practices guides
- Use Cases (very important for abstract projects)
- Documentation/Tutorials

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education".
