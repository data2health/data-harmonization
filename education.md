Data harmonization is more a process than an education goal.  Nevertheless, orientation to relevent concepts will be important:

- Orientation to the goals of federated data anlystics and inferencing
- Foster an understanding of common data models, and the disconance of having multipe "common" models
- Appreciation of the advantages of research data schema being anchored on clinical schema (e.g. FHIR)
- Elucidating the use cases for FHIR-based harmonization
- Documentaiton and tutorial on FHIR and FHIR data intrgration and harmonization processes

Please include education related issues where relevant, tagged with "education".
